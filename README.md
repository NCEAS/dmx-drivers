# dmx-drivers
This group seeks to identify drivers of ecosystem change in PWS and the GoA during the last 25 years, and aims to anticipate future changes given climate and fisheries management scenarios using Ecopath/Ecosim models.  Following ecological modeling efforts for these geographic locations, social community parameters will be added to these models to examine how changes in ecosystem services and management actions may influence human well-being.  

Group members: Tom Okey, Jim Ruzicka, Terri Klinger, Amber Himes-Cornell, Stephani Zador, Dan Monson, Jessica Couture, Rachael Blake, Colette Ward
